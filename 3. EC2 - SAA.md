# IP's 
+ There are 2 types of IP - Address
  + IPv4
  + IPv6
+  In general, an EC2 instance has
    - A private IP -> internal AWS network
    - A public IP -> ``www``
  
- ## PUBLIC IP 
    - Machine identified on ``www``
    - Unique across whole web
    - Can be geo located
    - Public IP has to be used to SSH into EC2 instance as we are not in same network to use private IP
- ## PRIVATE IP 
    - Machine identified on private network
    - Unique across private network 
    - Two different networks can have same private IP
    - Only specified range of IPs can be used 
    - Machines connect to ``www`` via NAT device + internet gateway (proxy)

- ## ELASTIC IP 
    - Stopping and restarting an EC2 instance changes its public IP .
    - An Elastic IP is used for fixed public IPv4 for a EC2 instance
    - It can be attached only to one instance at a time
    - One account can have a total of 5 Elastic IPs ( Can ask AWS to increase limit if needed)
    - ### Disadvantage:
      -  Reflects poor architectural decisions
    - ### Alternatives :
        - Using random public IP and register a DNS name to it
        - Using load balancer
    




# Placement Groups

- AWS allows us to decide how the EC2 instances needs to be placed in their hardware

- 3 Different ways are:
  - Cluster
  - Spread
  - Partition
- ## CLUSTER 
  - Instances grouped together in a low latency hardware setup within single AZ
  - ### Advantage :
      - High performance
      - Super low latency
      - Great network speed
  - ### Disadvantage:
      - High risk
      - If hardware fails, then all instances will fail
  - ### Use case :
      - Big data job
      - An application that requires extremely low latency and high network throughput
      - Non - critical application

- ## SPREAD 
  - Instances spread across different hardware
  - Instances failure are isolated
  
  - ### Advantage :
      - Minimized risk of simultaneous failure 
      - Span across multiple AZ
  
  - ### Disadvantage:
      - Can have only 7 EC2 instances per placement group per AZ

  - ### Use case :
      - Application requiring high availability
      - Critical application 
        
- ## PARTITION 
  - Instances spread across different partitions; partitions spread across different sets of hardware within an AZ
  - Instances failure are not isolated but one partition isolated from another partition of failure
  - Can have 7 partitions per AZ
  - ### Advantage :
      - Span across multiple AZ in single region
      - Run 100s of EC2 instances
      - Each partition failure is isolated
      - EC2 instances get access to partition info as metadata

  - ### Use case :
      - HDFS
      - Hadoop
      - Cassandra
      - Kafka

# Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

+ Component that makes EC2 instances to access the internet
- Represents virtual network card & A logical component in a VPC
+ An ENI is created by default when you create an EC2 instance. However, you can create an ENI separately and attach it to an EC2 instance
+ One EC2 instance can have multiple ENIs attached to it
+ An ENI comes with:
  + A Public IPv4
  + A Private IPv4
  + One Elastic IPv4 per private IPv4
+ One or more Security groups (SG) can also be attached to ENIs
+ Secondary ENIs come with only private IPv4s not public IPv4s. But you can attach an Elastic IP to an ENI to get a public IP for the ENI, used a a failover 
+ Bound to a specific AZ. (i.e) An ENI created in one AZ can be attached to an EC2 instance running only in that specific AZ

# EC2 Hibernate

- Starting an EC2 instance, Boots the OS and EC2 user data script is run.
- Its a time consuming work as after OS boots up, Application starts & Caches get warmed up
- On hibernating EC2 instance, in-memory (RAM) state is preserved
  - instance boot will be faster
  - the RAM state is written to a file in **root EBS volume**
  - root EBS volume must have enough space and should be encrypted
- ### Use case :
  - For long-running process
  - Saving RAM state
  - Faster boot up
- Instance RAM size must be less than 150 GB
- Hibernation can not be more than 60 days

# EC2 Nitro

- Next gen of EC2 instances & Uses new virtualization technology
- ### Advantages :
  - Allows better performance
  - Better networking options:
    - Enhanced networking
    - HPC
    - Uses IPv6
  - Better security
- **Higher speed EBS** -> increased level of IOPS
- Instance types : c5, c6, D3, M5 types

# vCPUs 
- vCPUs -> Virtual CPUs 
- Multiple threads run on one CPU
- Each thread is a vCPU
- eg : m5.2xlarge
```.py
  4 CPU * 2 threads per CPU => 8 vCPUs
```
- vCPUs can be changed by:
    - Decreasing no. of CPU cores
    - Decreasing no. of threads per Core

# EC2 capacity reservations

- If you need to plan in advance for capacity and make sure that you can launch instances in an AZ of a specific type around the specific time frame then use EC2 capacity reservations.

- Get billed as soon as it starts

- No planned end-date for reservation

- Specification required :
    - AZ
    - No. of instances
    - Instance attributes
        - Type
        - Tenancy
        - Platform / OS
