# RDS
+ RDS -> Relational Database Service
+ Managed DB service 
+ DB's available in AWS
  + Postgres
  + MySQL
  + MariaDB
  + Oracle
  + Microsoft SQL Server
  + Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)
+ **Advantages**:
  + Managed service
  + Automated provisioning, OS patching
  + Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp 
  + Monitoring dashboards
  + Read replicas for improved read performance
  + Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  + Maintenance windows for upgrades
  + Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  + Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
  + BUT you can’t SSH into your instances
+ ## RDS - Backup
  + Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
  + Automated backups:
    + Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
    + Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
    + Ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
    + 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
  + DB Snapshots:
    + Manually triggered by the user
    + Retention of backup for as long as you want

+ ## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling
  + Increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
  + User have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
  + Automatically modify storage if:
    + Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
    + Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
    + 6 hours have passed since last modification
  + Useful for **Unpredictable Workloads**
  + Supports all RDS - DB engines
  
## RDS Read Replicas
+ ## Read Scalability

  + Up to **5 Read Replicas**
  + Within AZ , Cross AZ or Cross Region
  + Replication is **ASYNC**, so reads are eventually consistent
  + Replicas can be promoted to their own DB 
  + **Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas**

+ ## Use Cases
  + Reporting Application can be run using **Read-Replicas** while the production server taking normal load

+ ## Network Cost
  + `FREE` -> Same region ASYNC Replication
  + `COST` -> Cross region ASYNC Replication

## RDS - Multi AZ ( DR )
  + **SYNC** Replication
  + One DNS name – automatic app failover to standby
  + Increase availability
  + Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
  + No manual intervention in apps
  + Not used for scaling
  + Multi-AZ replication is free
  + **Note**: The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery ( DR )
+ ## Single AZ to Multi AZ
  + Zero downtime operation ( no need to stop DB )
  + Need to **Modify** the DB

## RDS Security - Encryption
+ At **REST** Encryption
  + Possibility to encrypt the master & read replicas with AWS `KMS - AES-256` encryption
  + Encryption has to be defined at launch time 
  + **If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted**
+ **In-Flight** Encryption
  + SSL - Certificates to encrypt data to RDS in flight
  + Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connecting to database
  + To enforce SSL:
    + **PostgreSQL**: rds.force_ssl=1 in the AWS RDS Console (Parameter Groups)
    + **MySQL**: Within the DB, give the following command - **`GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;`**
+ ## Encryption Operation
  + **Encrypting RDS backups**
    + Snapshots of un-encrypted RDS databases are un-encrypted
    + Snapshots of encrypted RDS databases are encrypted
    + Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one
  + **To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database**
    + Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
    + Copy the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
    + Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot
    + Migrate applications to the new database, and delete the old database
     
## RDS Security - Network & IAM
+ **Network Security**
  + RDS databases are usually deployed within a private subnet, not in a public one
  + RDS security works by leveraging security groups ( same as EC2 instances) – it controls which IP / security group can communicate with RDS
+ **Access Management**
  + IAM policies help control who can manage AWS RDS (through the RDS API)
  + Traditional Username and Password can be used to login into the database
  + IAM-based authentication can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL
+ ## RDS - IAM Authentication
  + IAM database authentication works with **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**
  + No need of password, just an authentication token from IAM & RDS API calls is enough
  + **Benefits**:
    + Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
    + IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB
    + Can leverage IAM Roles and EC2 Instance profiles for easy integration

+ ## RDS Security - Summary
  + Encryption at rest:
    + Is done only when you first create the DB instance
    + `Un-encrypted DB` => `snapshot` => `copy snapshot as encrypted` => `create DB from snapshot`
  + User responsibility:
    + Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB’s SG
    + In-database user creation and permissions or manage through IAM
    + Creating a database with or without public access
    + Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
  + AWS responsibility:
    + No SSH access
    + No manual DB patching
    + No manual OS patching
    + No way to audit the underlying instance

# Aurora

+ Proprietary technology from AWS
+ Supports - `MYSQL` & `Postgres`
+ AWS cloud optimized
  + `5x` performance on `MYSQL` over RDS

+ ## Aurora - Custom Endpoints
  + Define a subset of Aurora Instances as a Custom Endpoint
  + **Eg**: Run analytical queries on specific replicas
  + The Reader Endpoint is generally not used after defining Custom Endpoints

+ ## Aurora Serverless
  + Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
  + Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
  + No capacity planning needed
  + Pay per second, can be more **cost-effective**

+ ## Aurora Multi-Master
  + In case you want immediate failover for write node (HA)
  + Every node does R/W - vs promoting a RR as the new master

+ ## Global Aurora
  + **Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas**:
    + Useful for disaster recovery
    + Simple to put in place
  + **Aurora Global Database (recommended)**:
    + 1 Primary Region (read / write)
    + Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
    + Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region 
    + Helps for decreasing latency
    + Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute

# Amazon ElastiCache
  + ElastiCache is to get managed **Redis** or **Memcached**
  + Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
  + Reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads
  + Makes application stateless
  + AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching,  optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups 
  + **Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes**
  
+ ## SAA - DB Cache
  + Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache 
  + Helps relieve load in RDS
  + Cache must have an invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/180648886-8ae127b3-32aa-4ae4-8b3a-7876a8439492.png)

+ ## SAA - User Session Store
  + User logs into any of the application 
  + The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
  + The user hits another instance of our application
  + The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in
  + Faster when compared to storing session data in RDB

+ ## Redis vs Memcached

+ ## Cache Security
  + Do not support IAM authentication
  + IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
  + **Redis AUTH**
    + User can set a “password/token” when you create a Redis cluster
    + This is an extra level of security for your cache
    + Support SSL in flight encryption
  + **Memcached**
    + Supports SASL-based authentication

+ ## Patterns for ElastiCache
  + **Lazy Loading** : All the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache
  + **Write Through** : Adds or update data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale data)
  + **Session Store** : Store temporary session data in a cache (using TTL features)

+ ## Redis Use Case
  + Gaming Leader-boards are computationally complex
  + Redis Sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering 
  + Each time a new element added, it’s ranked in real time, then added in correct order
