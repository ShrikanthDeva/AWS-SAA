# Scalability & High Availability
+ Scalability -> Application / system handling greater loads by adapting
+ There are two kinds of scalability:
  + Vertical Scalability 
  + Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
+ ## Vertical Scalability
  + Increasing the size of the instance **(= scale up / down)**
  + ``t2.micro`` -> ``t2.large``
  + Common for non distributed systems, such as a database
  + **EG** : RDS , Elastic-Cache
  + There's a limit for vertical scaling (Hardware limit)
+ ## Horizontal Scalability
  + Increasing the number of instances / systems for your application **(= scale out / in)**
  + Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems
  + This is very common for web applications / modern applications
+ ## High Availability
  + Usually goes hand in hand with Horizontal scaling
  + It  means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== Availability Zones)
  + Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
  + **GOAL** : Survive a data center loss
  + High Availability :
    + Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
    + Load Balancer multi AZ

# Load Balancing
+ Servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream
+ ### USES:
  + Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your  application
  + Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
  + Do regular health checks to your instances
  + Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
  + Enforce stickiness with cookies
  + High availability across zones
  + Separate public traffic from private traffic
+ ### WHY ELB?
  + Managed Load Balancer
    + AWS guaranteed ( working )
    + AWS takes care of ``upgrade``,``maintenance``,``high availability``
    + AWS provides few configuration knobs
  + More effort required for custom Load balancer
  + Integrated with many AWS offering
+ ### Health Checks
  + Enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
  + The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
  + If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy
+ ### TYPES
  + Classic Load Balancer (v1 -old -2009)
    + Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP) protocols
  + Application Load Balancer (v2 -new -2016)
    + Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket Protocols   
  + Network Load Balancer (v2 -new -2017)
    + Supports TCP, TLS (Secure TCP), UDP
  + Gateway Load Balancer (2020)
    + Operates on Network Layer (Layer 3). Uses IP

## Classic Load Balancer (v1 -old -2009)
+ Supports TCP (Layer 4) and HTTP, HTTPS (Layer 7)
+ Uses TCP or HTTP based health checks
+ Provides fixed hostname

## Application Load Balancer (v2 -new -2016) 
+ ALB is Layer 7 (HTTP)
+ Latency : 400 ms
+ Provides fixed hostname
+ **Load balancing to** :
  + Multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
  + Multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
+ **Support** :
  + HTTP/2 and WebSocket
  + Redirects from ``HTTP`` to ``HTTPS``
+ **Routing table** to different target groups , where routing is based on
  + Path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
  + Hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
  + Query String, Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
+ ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
+ Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic  port in ECS
+ Multiple CLB per application = 1 ALB
+ **ALB TARGET GROUPS**
  + ``EC2`` - Managed by ASG - HTTP
  + ``ECS`` - Managed by ECS - HTTP
  + ``Lambda Function`` - HTTP request translated into JSON event
  + ``IP Addresses`` - Must be private
  + Can route to multiple TG
  + Health checks are TG level
+ Application server don't see the IP of the client directly -
  + ``X-Forwarded-For`` - true IP of client is inserted in this header
  + ``X-Forwarded-Port`` - contains the port
  + ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` - contains the protocol

## Network Load Balancer (v2 -new -2017)
+ Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
  + Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
  + Handle millions of request per seconds
  + Less latency ~100 ms
+ **NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP**
+ NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
+ Not included in the AWS free tier
+ **NLB TARGET GROUPS**
  + ``EC2`` instances
  + ``IP Addresses`` - Must be private
  + ``ALB``

## Gateway Load Balancer
+ Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
+ **Example**: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, payload manipulation
+ Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) – IP Packets
+ Combines the following functions:
  + **Transparent Network Gateway** – single entry/exit for all traffic
  + **Load Balancer** – distributes traffic to your virtual
appliances
+ Uses the **GENEVE** protocol on port **6081**
+ **GLB TARGET GROUPS**
  + ``EC2`` instances
  + ``IP Addresses`` - Must be private

## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
+ It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
+ This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers
+ The **cookie** used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
+ **Use case** : Make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data
+ Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

+ ### Cookie Names
  + **Application-based Cookies**
    + **Custom cookie**
      + Generated by the target
      + Can include any custom attributes required by the application
      + Cookie name must be specified individually for  each target group
      + Don’t use **AWSALB**, **AWSALBAPP** or **AWSALBTG** (reserved for use by the ELB)
    + **Application cookie**
      + Generated by the load balancer
      + Cookie name is **AWSALBAPP**
  +  **Duration-based Cookies**
     + Cookie generated by the load balancer
     + Cookie name is **AWSALB** for ALB & **AWSELB** for CLB

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing

+ **Classic Load Balancer**
  + Disabled by default
  + No charges for inter AZ data if enabled
+ **Application Load Balancer**
  + Always on (can’t be disabled)
  + No charges for inter AZ data
+ **Network Load Balancer**
  + Disabled by default
  + You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled

## SSL/TLS
+ An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
+ ``SSL`` refers to **Secure Sockets Layer**, used to encrypt  connections
+ ``TLS`` refers to **Transport Layer Security**, which is a newer version
+ Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate  Authorities (CA) like - Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy
+ SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed
+ ### Load Balancer - SSL Certificate
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/180491254-0bb2de34-1d4f-40b0-983a-92c08ad954f7.png)

  + Uses an `X.509` certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
  + Manage certificates using ACM ( AWS Certificate Manager )
  + Own certificates can be created and uploaded
  + **HTTPS Listener**:
    + Must specify a default certificate
    + Can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
    + Clients can use **SNI** (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
    + Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL / TLS (legacy client
+ ### SSL – Server Name Indication (SNI)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/180492573-87684721-329c-4c77-9ca1-15950facb5bf.png)
  + SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server (to serve multiple websites)
  + It’s a **newer** protocol, and requires the client to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
  + The server will then find the correct certificate or return the default one
  + **NOTE**:
    + Only works for ALB & NLB (newer generation), CloudFront
    + Does not work for CLB (older gen)
+ ### ELB - SSL Certificates
  + Classic Load Balancer (v1)
    + Support only one SSL certificate
    + Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates
  + Application Load Balancer (v2)
    + Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
    + Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work
  + Network Load Balancer (v2)
    + Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
    + Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work
## Connection Draining

  + Feature Renaming
    + **Connection Draining** – for CLB
    + **De-registration Delay** – for ALB & NLB
  + Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
  + Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
  + Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds)
  + Can be disabled (set value to 0)
  + Set to a low value if your requests are short
