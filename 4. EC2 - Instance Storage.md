# EBS Volume
+ EBS -> Elastic Block Store
+ Its a network drive (not a physical drive) that can be attached to EC2 instances
  + Uses network to communicate with the instances
  + Can be attached and detached from EC2 quickly
+ It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination.
  + Billed for all the provisioned capacity
  + Capacity can be increased in due time
+ They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level) , Multi-attach used at Associate level
+ Bounded to AZ
  + To move across AZ , You need to snapshot
+ By default (Delete on termination attribute)
  + Root EBS Volume gets deleted when an EC2 instance terminates ( ON )
  + Other attached EBS Volume is not deleted ( OFF )

# EBS Snapshots
+ Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
+ Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
+ Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region
+ ## Features
  + ### EBS Snapshot Archive
    + Move a Snapshot to an ”archive tier” that is 75% cheaper
    + Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
  + ### Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
    + Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
    + Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)


# AMI 
+ AMI -> Amazon Machine Image
+ AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  + You add your own software, configuration, operating  system, monitoring…
  + Faster boot / configuration time because all your  software is pre-packaged
+ AMI are built for a specific region ( can be copied across regions )
+ You can launch EC2 instances from:
  + **A Public AMI**: AWS provided
  + **Your own AMI**: you make and maintain them yourself
  + **An AWS Marketplace AMI**: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
+ ## AMI Process
  + Start an EC2 instance and customize it
  + Stop the instance (for data integrity)
  + Build an AMI – this will also create EBS snapshots
  + Launch instances from other AMIs

# EC2 Instance Store
+ Network drives with good but limited performance
+ High performance hardware disk
+ Better I/O performance
+ Instance Store will loose their storage, if EC2 instance is stopped
+ Risk for data loss if hardware fails
+ Backup & Replication are user responsibility
+ **Use Case**:
  + High performance required application
  + Application which doesn't care about data loss
  + Buffer, Cache, Scratch data, Temporary content

# EBS Volume Types

+ Comes in 6 Types :
  + General Purpose (SSD) - ``gp2``,``gp3``
  + High Performance (SSD) - ``io1``,``io2``
  + HDD - ``st1``,``sc1``

+ ## General Purpose SSD
  + Cost effective & Low latency
  + System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
  + 1 GiB - 16 TiB
  + ### ``gp3`` :
    + Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
    + Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s **independently**
  + ### ``gp2`` :
    + Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
    + Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
    + 3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at the max IOPS

+ ## Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
  + Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
  + Applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
  + Great for databases workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
    + ### ``io1/io2`` (4 GiB - 16 TiB) :
      + Max PIOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other
      + Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
      + io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB (at the same price as io1)
    + ### ``io2 Block Express`` (4 GiB – 64 TiB) :
      + Sub-millisecond latency
      + Max PIOPS: 256,000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1,000:1
      + Supports EBS Multi-attach

+ ## Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
  + Cannot be a boot volume
  + 125 GiB to 16 TiB
  + ### Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
    + Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing
    + Max throughput 500 MiB/s – max IOPS 500
  + ### Cold HDD (sc1):
    + For data that is infrequently accessed
    + Scenarios where lowest cost is important
    + Max throughput 250 MiB/s – max IOPS 250

# EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2 family

+ Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
+ Each instance has full read & write permissions to the volume
+ **Use Case**:
  + Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (ex: Teradata)
  + Concurrent write operations

# EBS - Encryption

+ When EBS Volume is created -
  + Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
  + All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
  + All snapshots are encrypted
  + All volumes created from the snapshot
+ Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
+ Encryption : Minimal impact on Latency
+ **NOTE** :
  + EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
  + Copying an un-encrypted snapshot allows encryption
  + Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted

+ ## Encrypt -> Un-encrypted EBS Volume
  + Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
  + Encrypt the EBS snapshot ( using copy )
  + Create new ebs volume from the snapshot ( the volume will also be encrypted )
  + Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance

# EFS - Elastic File System

+ Managed Network File System mounted on EC2
+ EFS works with EC2 instances in **multi-AZ**
+ Compatible with Linux based AMI not for Windows
+ Uses SG to control access to EFS
+ Encryption at rest 
+ Expensive (3x times gp2 cost)
+ Scales automatically , Pay-Per-Use, No capacity planning
+ **Use Case** :
  + Content management
  + Web serving
  + Data sharing
  + Wordpress
+ ## EFS - Performance
    + ### EFS Scale
      + Concurrent NFS clients
      + 10 Gb+ throughput
      + Grow Pb-scale network automatically
    + ### Performance Mode
      + **General Purpose** : Latency sensitive use cases
      + **Max I/O** : Higher latency, throughput, highly parallel
    + ### Throughput Mode
      + **Bursting** : Throughput scales with file system size
      + **Provisioned** : Throughput fixed at specified amount

+ ## EFS - Storage Classes
  + ### Storage Tiers
    + Lifecycle management feature  ( moves after N days )
    + **Standard** : Frequently accessed files
    + **Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)** : Lower price to store infrequent files, costs only to retrieve files
  + ### Availability & Durability
    + **Regional** : Multi-AZ for PROD
    + **One-Zone** : Great for DEV & backup
  + Over 90% cost saving
