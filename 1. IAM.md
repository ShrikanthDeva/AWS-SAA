# Identity Access Management - (IAM)

+ IAM -> Identity Access Management
+ Global service not scoped to a region
+ People within the organization can be grouped together.
+ A user can belong to single or multiple groups & can belong to none also.
+ A group can contain only users not another group .
+ IAM user with Admin privilege is preferred over Root account

# IAM - Permission
+ Permission for a user is defined by the policies attached to them & Polices are nothing but JSON documents.
+ LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE ( only needed permissions are provided) is used .

# IAM - Policies
+ Policies associated with a group is applicable to all users in the group
+ **INLINE POLICY** is used for a specific user or a user who doesn't belong to any group.

+ ## POLICY STRUCTURE
  + **Version** : policy language version
  + **Id** : identifier for the policy (optional)
  + **Statement** : one or more individual statements
    + **Sid** : an identifier for the statement (optional)
    + **Effect** : whether the statement allows or denies access
    + **Principal** : account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    + **Action** : list of actions this policy allows or denies
    + **Resource** : list of resources to which the actions applied to
    + **Condition** : conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

# Security
## Password Policy
+ Stronger the password higher the security.
+ Specific requirements can be given such as
  + Uppercase
  + Lowercase
  + Numbers
  + Non-alpha-num characters 

+ Users can be allowed to change their passwords.
+ Password expiration can be set
+ Re-use of password can be prevented
  
## MFA Device
+ Multi Factor Authentication is used in order to protect Root accounts and IAM users
+ MFA =  password you know + security device you own
+ For a successful login you need your password as well as you MFA device.
+ Even when password is hacked , account is not compromised until MFA device is connected
+ MFA Options:
  + Virtual MFA Device: Google Authenticator (for phone only), Authy (multi-device)
  + U2F Key (looks like an USB): One key for root account, and IAM users as well
  + Hardware key Fob MFA Device
Hardware Key fob AWS GovCloud(US)

# AWS - CLI & SDK
+ You can access AWS in three possible ways
    + AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
    + AWS CLI (protected by access keys)
    + AWS SDK (protected by access keys)
+ Access keys are generated from the AWS console and should not be shared
  + **Access key ID ~= username**
  + **Secret Access Key ~= password**

+ AWS CLI -> Access AWS through the Command Line Interface.
+ AWS SDK -> Access AWS through the Software Development Kit which is a set of libraries embedded in your application.

# AWS - CloudShell
+ Browser based AWS offering of CLI terminal
+ All the files that is created in the CloudShell environment is retained even when cloudShell is restarted.
+ You can upload/download files from/to the CloudShell environment

# IAM - Roles
+ An IAM Role is created for AWS Services to use AWS resources on our behalf
+ Common Roles :
  + EC2 Instance Roles
  + Lambda Function Roles
  + Roles for CloudFormation

# IAM Security Tools
+   ## Credentials Report (Account-level)
    +  Lists the users and status of their credentials
+ ## Access Advisor (User-level)
  + Shows the services that has been accessed by the users and when they were recently accessed
  + Used to revise IAM policies if needed (applying least privilege principle)

# IAM Best Practices
+ Use root account only for setting up account
+ IAM user with Admin privilege is preferred over Root account
+ Do not share root user credentials
+ Use strong password policy and enable MFA
+ Assign users to groups and add permissions to groups rather than assigning permissions directly to the user
+ Follow Least Privilege Principle using Credentials Report

# Key Words
+ **USERS** : Mapped to a physical user
+ **GROUPS** : Contains group of users
+ **POLICIES** : JSON document outlining the permissions for users and groups
+ **ROLES** : For EC2 instances, AWS services
+ **SECURITY** : MFA + Password Policy
+ **ACCESS KEYS** : access AWS using CLI or SDK
