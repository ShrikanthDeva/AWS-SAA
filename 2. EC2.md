# ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD - (EC2)

+ EC2 -> Elastic Compute Cloud ( Infrastructure as a Service )
+ Consists in the capability of :

    + **EC2** -> Renting virtual machines (Elastic Compute Cloud)
    + **EBS** -> Storing data on virtual drives (Elastic Block Storage )
    + **ELB** -> Distributing load across machines (Elastic Load Balance)
    + **ASG** -> Scaling services ( Auto Scaling Group )

# EC2 - sizing and configuration options

+ OS : Linus/Windows/Mac OS
+ Compute Power and cores (CPU)
+ RAM
+ Storage Space -
    + Network attached (EBS and EFS)
    + Hardware/ Physical Storage (EC2 Instance Store)
+ Network card 
+ Firewall rules : Security Groups to control incoming and outgoing traffic
# EC2 User Data

+ To bootstrap EC2 instances
+ Runs only during the first start of the EC2 instance
+ Runs with the root user
+ Used to:
    + Install packages
    + Update/Upgrade packages

+ Has sudo privileges

+ An example :
    ```
    #! /bin/bash
    # Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
    # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Hello world from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
# EC2 instance Types
+ General Purpose EC2 Instances - Balanced & Web servers 
+ Compute Optimized EC2 instances - For compute-intensive tasks
+ Memory Optimized EC2 instances - In-memory DBs, cache
+ Storage Optimized EC2 instances - Databases & more!

+ ## GENERAL PURPOSE -

  + Great for diversity of workloads such as web browsers
  balance b/w :
    + Compute
    + Memory
    + Networking
  + ``t2.micro`` -> general purpose EC2 instance


+ ## COMPUTE OPTIMIZED -

  + Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
    + Batch processing workloads
    + Media transcoding
    + High performance web servers
    + High performance computing
    + Scientific modeling & machine learning
    + Dedicated gaming servers
  + ``c5d.4xlarge`` -> Compute Optimized EC2 instance (**c** - series )


+ ## MEMORY OPTIMIZED -

    + Great for fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
    + Use case :
      + High performance relational/non relational databases
      + Distributed web scale cache stores in-memory databases optimized for Business Intelligence (BI)
      + Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
    + ``r5.16xlarge`` -> memory optimized EC2 instance (**r** - series )

+ ## STORAGE OPTIMIZED 
  + Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
  + Use cases :
    + High frequency online transaction processing systems
    + Relational & NoSQL databases
    + Cache for in-memory databases
    + Data warehousing applications
    + Distributed file system
    + ``d2, d3, h1`` series are used

# Security Groups
+ It's basically a firewall for EC2 instances
+ It controls the incoming traffic and outgoing traffic from/to the EC2 instances
+ It lives outside the EC2 instances, so if a traffic is blocked, an EC2 instance would not even see it
+ Security Groups are scoped to a Region/VPC
+ Security Groups contains only **ALLOW** rules :
  + All inbound traffic is blocked by default
  + All outgoing traffic is allowed by default
+ ``Timeout error`` -> Security Group issue
+ ``Connection refused error`` -> Application issue
+ One Security Groups can be attached to multiple instances
+ One instance can have multiple Security Groups

# Ports
+ **22** - SSH
+ **21** - FTP
+ **22** - SFTP (Secure FTP). File transfer using SSH
+ **80** - HTTP
+ **443** - HTTPS
+ **3389** - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) for logging into Windows instance

# Connecting to an Instance
+ There are three ways that you can connect to an EC2 instance 
+ **SSH** - for Linux/Mac/Windows10+
+ **PuTTy** - for any version of Windows
+ **EC2 Instance Connect** - can connect to EC2 instance from the AWS console
+ **NOTE** : You need to have port 22 enabled to use EC2 instance connect



# Purchasing Options
+ ## On-demand
    + Billed per second, after the first minute on Linux  and Windows
    + Billed per minute on other OS
    + Reserved Instances - 1 or 3 years commitment
    + Here, you reserve Instance type, Region, tenancy, OS
    + High DIscount | full upfront > partial upfront > no upfront | Low Discount
    + Convertible Reserved Instance option available, where instance type, instance family, region, tenancy can be changed
+ ## Savings Plan
  + 1 or 3 years commitment
  + High Discount || full upfront > partial upfront > no upfront || Low Discount
  + Committed to certain amount.
  + Billed on On-demand price after exhausting savings plan
  + Locked to Instance family and Region. 
  + Flexible across Instance Size, OS, Tenancy

+ ## Spot Instance
  + Highest Discount
  + Used to run applications resilient to failure
  + Instance is lost if bid price is greater than current price

+ ## Dedicated Host
  + Most expensive option
  + Complete physical server dedicated to use
  + Controls instance placement
  + Reserving options available for more discount
  + This option allows user to server-bound software licenses

+ ## Dedicated Instances
  + Instances run on dedicated hardware
  + Hardware may be shared with instances in the same account

+ ## Capacity Reservations
  + Allows to reserve capacity for EC2 instances in a specific AZ
  + No time commitment
  + You are billed even if instance is not running because the capacity is reserved
  + Charge at On-demand rate

# Spot Instances
+ To initiate a spot request, you specify the following
  + Max Price
  + No. of instances
  + Launch Configuration
  + Request type -> One-time / Persistent
  + Valid From, Valid Until
+ If the spot price is greater than the max price, the instance is lost
+ You are given two operations to perform within a grace period of two minutes after the price becomes greater
  + Stop
  + Terminate
  + ``Stopping`` the instance will allow you to restart the instance if the spot price drops below the max price again
  + However, fresh instances are started if the instances are configured to be ``terminated``
+ Spot prices do vary based on AZ
+ ### Persistent
  + The Spot Request keeps on requesting for spot instances once the instances are terminated
  + So, if you need to actually stop an instance, you need to cancel the spot request first and then stop the instances
  + Because, if you stop the instance first, the request is automatically going to request another instance
+ Cancelling a spot request does not terminate spot instances. You need to terminate them separately

+ ### One-time
  + It only requests for spot requests once, ie. until the request is satisfied

# Spot Fleet
+ Spot Fleet = Spot instances + On-demand instances
+ You define a number of launch pools for Spot fleet to choose from
+ Launch pools consists of variations of OS, AZ, Instance type (M5 large)
+ Spot fleet chooses from the best launch pool according to the launch strategy and meet the target capacity
+ Launch strategies can be
  + **LowestPrice**: Launches from the optimal pool which provides the lowest price
  + **Diversified**: Launches from multiple pools
  + **CapacityOptimized**: Pool with optimal capacity
