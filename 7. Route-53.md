# DNS
+ DNS -> Domain Name System
+ Translates host-names to machine's IP addresses
+ www.google.com => `172.217.18.36`
+ ## DNS Terminologies
+ **Domain Registrar**: Where you register your domain Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy....
+ **DNS Records**: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS...
+ **Zone File**: Contains all DNS Records
+ **Name Servers**: Used to resolve DNS queries
+ **Top Level Domain (TLD)**: .com, .net, .org...
+ **Second Level Domain (SLD)**: amazon.com, google.com...

+ ## How DNS Works
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/181330035-c18b72b5-942f-4e57-b381-ff839ecb0852.png)


# Route 53
  + It is a highly available, scalable, fully managed and authoritative DNS Service
      + **Authoritative** = The customer can update the DNS Records
  + It is also a Domain Registrar
  + It also has the ability to check the health of the resources
  + Provides 100% availability SLA ( Service Level Agreement )   
  + **100% availability SLA** means that Route 53 is 100% available service. If it is not available anytime, you get some credits based on the agreement

+ ## Route 53 - Records
  + Each record determines how you want to route traffic for a domain
  + A DNS Record contains the following
      + **Domain Name / Subdomain name** -> `example.com`
      + **Record Type** ->  `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `NS`
      + **IP address**: Actual address to which the traffic needs to be routed to 
      + **Routing Policy** -> how Route 53 responds to queries
      + **TTL**( Time To Live ) : Duration until which the DNS record should be cached in the DNS Resolver

+ ## Record Types
  + `A`: An A-record maps a hostname to an IPv4 address
  + `AAAA`: Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address
  + `CNAME`: Maps one hostname to another hostname
      + The hostname must be an A/AAAA record
      + CNAME cannot be used for tip of the domain (zone apex)
      + **Eg**: CNAME cannot be used to map `example.com` but can be used for `www.example.com`
  + `NS`: NameServers for the hosted zone
      + These are the servers that responds to your DNS queries for your hosted zone

+ ## Hosted Zones
  + It is a container for Records that defines how the traffic is to routed to your domains/subdomains
  + **Public Hosted Zone** :  Contains records that specifies how the Internet traffic is routed
  + **Private Hosted Zone** : Contains records that specifies how the traffic within your VPC is routed

+ ## TTL 
  + TTL -> Time To Live
  + TTL defines the duration until which the record will be cached in the client's computer
  + So within this duration, if the web browser requests an IP for the same hostname, it is fetched from the cache, not from Route53
  + **High TTL** (24 Hr) -
      + Records will be outdated for that time period incase if you modify your record
      + Less costs incurred on Route53 because less requests received
  + **Low TTL** (60 Sec) -
      + Records are updated quick incase of any change in the record
      + Can cost more if, more request for DNS queries is sent to Route53
  + **Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for every DNS record**

+ ## CNAME vs ALIAS record
  + ### CNAME
      + Used to map a hostname to **Another Hostname**
      + The hostname must be an A/AAAA record
      + Only works for a **Non-Root Domain**
      + **Eg** : `something.example.com`
  + ### ALIAS
      + Used to map a hostname to an **AWS resource**
      + Can be used for both, a **Root Domain** - `example.com` as well as **Non-Root Domain** - `something.example.com`
      + We can map a hostname to these DNS endpoints
      + It has native health checks
      + Free of charge
      + Alias Record is always of type A/AAAA record for AWS resources
      + You can't set TTL for Alias records
      + An **EC2 instance DNS endpoint cannot be mapped**
      + Alias Record targets : `ELB`, `CloudFront Distribution` `API Gateway`, `Elastic Beanstalk Environments`, `S3 Websites`, `Global Accelerator`, `VPC Interface Endpoints`, `Route 53 Records in the same hosted Zone`

+ ## Route53 Routing Policies
  + A routing policy defines how Route53 responds to a DNS query
  + **Simple**
  + **Weighted**
  + **Failover**
  + **Latency Based**
  + **Geo-location**
  + **Multi-Value Answer**
  + **GeoProximity**
  
+ ## Simple Routing Policy
  
  + Returns a DNS record for the give hostname
  + You can also specify multiple values(IP) in the same record. If multiple values are specified, one is chosen randomly by the client
  + However, with Aliases enabled, you can only specify one AWS resource
  + This routing policy does not come with health checks

+ ## Weighted Routing Policy
  
  + Control the `%` of requests that go to each resource
  + Here, you can assign weight to multiple records and according to the weight assigned, the traffic will be sent to the resource on that record 
  + The records must have the **same hostname*+ and **same record type**
  + Can be associated with health checks
  + Assign a weight of 0 to a record to stop sending traffic to a resource
  + If all records have weight of 0, then all records will be returned equally
  + The weights don't have to sum up to 100
  + Assign a weight of 0 to a record to stop sending traffic to a resource
  + If all records have weight of 0, then all records will be returned equally
  + **Use cases**: load balancing between regions, testing new application versions

+ ## Latency Based Routing Policy
  
    + Redirect users based on the least latency
    + Here, we create multiple records with the same hostname but with `latency routing policy`
    + So, when the users access the hostname, they are automatically redirected to the resource which will provide the lowest latency for them
    + Latency is based on traffic between users and AWS Regions
    + Can be associated with health checks (has failover capability)

+ ## Failover Routing Policy

  + According to the health check result, the record of the healthy instance is returned to the user
  + There can be only one primary and one secondary record
  + The primary record will have a mandatory health check, in case of unhealthy, it fail overs to the instance in the secondary record

+ ## Geo-location Routing Policy
  
  + **This routing is based on user location**
  + Specify the location by **Continent**, **Country** or by **State**
  + Should create a **Default** record , if the location does not match
  + Can be associated with health checks
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/181344442-e5e43bbe-40a6-4731-a1ac-92fea66f27ea.png)

    
+ ## GeoProximity Routing Policy

  + Route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of users and resources  
  + Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined `bias`
  + `Bias` values:
    + **Expand** - `1 to 99`
    + **Shrink** - `-1 to -99`  
  + A resource in a region with a higher bias will attract more traffic
  + A resource can be:
      + An AWS Resource (need to specify AWS Region)
      + Non-AWS Resource (need to specify Latitude and Longitude) 
  + You must use `Route53 Traffic Flow` to use this feature

+ ## Route53 Traffic Flow
  + A Visual Editor for creating and managing & simplifying more complex routing decision trees 
  + Configurations can be saved as `Traffic Flow Policy`
      + Can be applied to different Route53 hosted zones (ie- different domain names)
      + Supports versioning
  + Multiple Policies can be probably chained in a `traffic flow policy`

+ ## Multi-Value Routing Policy
  
  + Used when routing traffic to multiple resources
  + Route53 returns multiple values/resources 
  + Has health checks associated with it. So, only healthy records are returned
  + Up to 8 records can be returned for each `Multi-Value` query
  + It is different from specifying multiple records in `Simple Routing Policy` because, Simple Routing Policy does not have health checks associated with it, so it might return an unhealthy record, which is not the case in `Multi-value Routing Policy`
  + **Multi-Value is not a substitute for having an ELB**

## Route 53 Health Checks
  + HTTP based health checks for **public resources**
  + They allow you to perform automatic DNS failover
  + 3 types of health-checks:
      + On a particular endpoint
      + That monitor other health-checks (Calculated health-checks)
      + On CloudWatch alarms 
  + These health-checks are integrated with CloudWatch(CW) Metrics  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/181343585-e54947a4-fef1-4692-9c0e-c096da2ed351.png)
  + ## Health checks Monitoring Endpoint
    + About 15 global health-checkers will check the endpoint health
    + In these health-checks you can specify:
        + Healthy/unhealthy threshold
        + Health-checks Interval (defaults to 30s) | 10s interval -> more cost
        + Supported Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
        + Choice of Regions for Route53 to use
    + Health-checks passes only when endpoints responds with `2xx`/`3xx` status codes
    + Health-checks can also be set up to pass/fail based on checking the first `5120` bytes of a text-based response
    + Configure you router/firewall to allow incoming requests from Route 53 Health Checkers

  + ## Calculated Health Checks
    + A master health-checker monitors the child health-checks
    + Can check up to `256` child health-checks
    + Can specify amount of health-checks that need to pass, to make the master health-check healthy
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94846398/181344021-9b87193a-655c-4700-b87f-aaedc071fdad.png)


  + ## Health-check - Private Hosted Zones
    + You cannot directly use Route53 health-checks on private resources (both on-premises/privateVPC) because Route53 health-checkers live outside the VPC
    + You need to create a cloudWatch metric and associate a CloudWatch Alarm to it
    + The cloudWatch Alarm can be monitored using Route53 health-checks and is considered unhealthy if the CloudWatch Alarm is in the `alarm` state

## Domain Registrar vs DNS Service
  + Domain Registrars like **GoDaddy** also come with DNS Service. But you can choose to use a DNS Service of your choice as well. In our case - Amazon Route53
  + To use a 3rd party domain name:
      + You create a Hosted Zone in Route53 first
      + TUpdate NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 Name Servers
      + So, this way when a DNS query happens for your domain name, your domain registrar will provide the NameServers for your DNS Service which will contain all the DNS records for your domain
